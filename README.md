# XMonad
My personal XMonad (and xmobar) config.

Need to do: 
have gaps in tiled mode even with 1 window, 
make picom not make termite's borders transparent, 
make picom blur,
fix floating layout, 
make new windows become top of stack not below or above current window,
make all colors the same (like same transparence with bar and windows, chrome scheme matches bar),
