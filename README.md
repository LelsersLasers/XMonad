# XMonad
My personal XMonad (and xmobar) config.

Need to do: 
 have gaps in tiled mode even with 1 window
, fix floating layout
, make new windows become top of stack not below or above current window
, change color of window count
, make xmobar transparent
, make all colors the same (like same transparence with bar and windows, chrome scheme matches bar, dmenu theme)

Need to decide:
 
 picom:
 round corners or shawdows?
 shawdows on bar?
 shawdows on dmenu?
 dmenu or rofi?
